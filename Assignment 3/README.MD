### YUSRA KHAN 64146
WORKED ON KNN

K-Nearest Neighbour.  It classifies the data point on how its neighbor is classified based on the similarity measure of the earlier stored data points.
It take alot of time to train a model.

### SUMBUL SHABBIR 64128
WORKED ON LIDSTONE SMOOTHING.
Laplace smoothing is a smoothing technique that helps tackle the problem of zero probability in the Na√Øve Bayes machine learning algorithm.It works well enough in text classification problems such as spam filtering and the classification of reviews as positive or negative.

### MUFREAH AQEEL 64162
WORKED ON SVM(support vector machines):
Support Vector Machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification or regression challenges. In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.

### NAMISH ALI 64179
WORKED ON LAPLACE(KNAIVE BIASE):
laplace is a smoothing technique that help tackle the problem of zero probabilityin the naive bayes machine learning algorithm. using higher alpha values will push the likelihood towards a value of 0.5 and that is the probability of a word equal to 0.5 for both the positive and negative reviews.
