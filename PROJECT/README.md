#### WORKED ON KNN
1. KNN is basically a non-parameteric, lazy learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
2. It's easy to implement and understand, but has a major drawback of becoming slow as the size of data increases.
###### Problems We face
1. KNN didn't work properly on the large data set and in this project we have a very large data.
2. We applied KNN which is lazy model if we apply any other more efficient algorithm of machine learning or deep learning so maybe the results would be different.
3. Its memory intensive.
4. It took alot of time while training data.
5. It took alot of time to train data and getting accuracy so that we implement it manually and got the increasing accuracy in some hours.

#### LAPLACE(KNAIVE BIASE)
In laplace i have used the grid as well as confusion matrix for finding the accuracy. The problem was there were no any big effect on the accuracy by applying these algorithm and they are consuming too much time and the data are also very large.
### problems:
1. The data is very vast so it is taking too much time to train the data and laptop was heated.
2. I have applied the grid and confusion matrix for the accuracy but the accuracy is not so good.
3. I have checked the accuracy manually but it is still same.
4. After increasing the values the accuracy is not increasing.

#### SVM
Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.
##### Issues faced during training:
1. dataset was having memory issue
2. it was time consuming
3. laptop was heated rapidly and was not able to handle the processing.
4. cloud storage might be able to solve the problem by breaking it into small parts.

### Sumbul Shabbir 64128
#### Lidstone Smoothing
In this i have used grid search, minmax algorithm and Multinomial Naive Bayes Model.
###### PROBLEM I FACE:


I Tried Almost all alpha value but accuracy does not go beyond 54 even if I increase the value of alpha or cross validation there is no any big effect on the accuracy.

### Kausar Bilal 64211
#### perceptron
In this I have used two-class (binary) classification machine learning algorithm. It is a type of neural network model, perhaps the simplest type of neural network model. It consists of a single node or neuron that takes a row of data as input and predicts a class label.
###### PROBLEM I FACE:
in accuracy
